# SoundCloud-Activity-DiscordRPC
"SoundCloud to Discord Music Activity Display using Discord RPC" is a combined application with a browser extension and server-side component. The extension fetches track data from SoundCloud and sends it to a local server. Using Discord Rich Presence (RPC), the server displays information about the playing track in Discord.
